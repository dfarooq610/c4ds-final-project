            Preparing for Future Threats

      <article>
        <p>The Carlton Complex Fire has highlighted the need for increased investment in wildfire prevention and response. As climate change continues exacerbating drought conditions and increasing the risk of wildfires, policymakers and communities must work together to prioritize wildfire preparedness and response.</p>
        <p>State and local officials have taken steps to improve wildfire preparedness and response in response to the Carlton Complex Fire. These efforts include increasing funding for wildfire prevention programs and investing in new technology to better detect and respond to wildfires.</p>
        <p>The government's response to The Carlton Complex Fire would depend on which government entity you are referring to. As the fire occurred in Washington State, the primary response would have been from the state government, specifically the Washington State Department of Natural Resources and the Washington State Patrol.</p>

        <br></br>
        <br></br>

        <p>However, federal agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Forest Service may have also been involved. The specific actions these agencies took would vary but could include coordinating firefighting efforts, providing resources and support to affected communities, and conducting investigations into the cause of the fire.</p>
        <p>Debbie Grable and George Grable shared insights about the local government's response in the aftermath of the disaster.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <span className="soundcite" data-id={1494682795} data-start={652000} data-end={664000} data-plays={1}>
          As far as the actual government's response, the little towns here can do what
          they, but there is not much they don't have funds unless they get them from
          somewhere.
          </span>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>She said it was people's house, so it was never going to be fast enough, and she does not if how they were reimbursed after insurance from the government. <i>"Everyone's insurance rates have gone up because of the fire danger, and now we are in a dangerous place,"</i> Debbie Grable said.</p>
        <p>George Grable said a group of Mennonites reportedly receives financial assistance from FEMA to reconstruct homes for affected individuals. <i>"When it comes to individuals whose homes were destroyed by fire, we were unaware of their eligibility for aid,"</i> he stated.</p>
        <p>Vicki Yanarella and her husband, Danny Yanarella, also provided commentary on the government's response and actions taken following the fire.</p>
        
        <blockquote>When the government came to this area, and they gave the net how natives, they were giving them a choice between going to a reservation or having or being deeded plot a plot of land here.</blockquote>
        
        <p>She said two different agencies dealt with the native in this area, and they were both federal agencies. <i>"I don't know if there was any FEMA money from the government,"</i> Vicki Yanarella said. <i>"And that's interesting, and I don't think there were these fires, though, are declared national disasters."</i> But after that Danny Yanarella said one government thing she could think of is that flood when those winter lakes flooded, that was an irrigation system for the irrigation that runs in Benson Creek drainage. </p>
        <p><i>"I have some friends who live in Benson Creek,"</i> he said. <i>"It took their ditch organization, which is very small, several years to try and get some help fixing things.”</i> He said he thinks his friends finally got it from the conservation soil conservation district called Oak.</p>
        <p><i>"So that's the only thing I can really think about, and that I can really that comes to mind where there was some government assistance,"</i> Danny Yanarella said. <i>"That irrigation district that needed it really had to pursue it, but I would think FEMA mining would be easy enough to track down."</i></p>
        <p>Despite the devastation caused by the Carlton Complex Fire, the community has come together to support one another in rebuilding. The Carlton Complex Long Term Recovery Group and various volunteer organizations have provided aid and resources to those affected. The group's efforts have helped many families and individuals rebuild their homes and lives.</p>
        <p>While the scars of the fire will remain, the resilience and strength of the community in the face of adversity have been genuinely inspiring. The Carlton Complex Fire serves as a reminder of the importance of disaster preparedness and the need for ongoing support for those affected by natural disasters.</p>
        <p><i>"If I was at that moment again, I don't care that much about anything I own,"</i> Viki Yanarella said. She said she might grab her boxes of photos from when her kids were little if she had time. And those photos, she thinks, would be irreplaceable that everything else is replaceable.</p>

//       <h1>Here are things you can do to keep safe:</h1>
//       <div className="carousel">
//         <p>
//           1. Stay informed about the latest updates and warnings from local
//           authorities, and be prepared to evacuate if necessary.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           2. Create a defensible space around your home by removing any
//           flammable materials, such as dry leaves or brush, and trimming back
//           trees and shrubs.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           3. Keep a supply of emergency essentials, such as water, food,
//           first-aid supplies, and a battery-powered radio, in case you need to
//           evacuate quickly.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           4. Make sure your home is properly equipped with smoke detectors and
//           fire extinguishers, and that you know how to use them.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           5. Plan your escape routes in advance, and practice evacuating with
//           your family so everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           6. If you are trapped in a wildfire, seek shelter in a cleared area,
//           such as a road or a clearing, and cover yourself with a wet blanket or
//           towel to protect yourself from the heat and flames.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           7. Avoid driving through areas affected by wildfires, as smoke and
//           poor visibility can make driving dangerous.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           8. If you have pets, make sure they are properly identified and that
//           you have a plan for evacuating them as well.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           9. Be mindful of fire danger when camping or using outdoor equipment,
//           and make sure fires are properly extinguished before leaving the area.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           10. Be aware of the risks of post-wildfire hazards, such as mudslides
//           and flash floods, and take precautions to stay safe in the aftermath
//           of a fire.
//         </p>
